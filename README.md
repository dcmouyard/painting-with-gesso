Painting a Perfect Picture with Gesso
=====================================

Learn how to design and theme Drupal sites using modular design principles and the [Drupal 8 CSS architecture guidelines](https://www.drupal.org/node/1887918). At Forum One, we created the [Gesso](https://www.drupal.org/project/gesso) theme to vastly improve Drupal’s default markup and styles, giving us a nice clean canvas to start each Drupal project with. We also created a version of [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) that outputs the same markup and styles as the Gesso theme, allowing us to quickly design and prototype reusable design components, layouts, and pages.

## Topics Covered

* Design for Drupal with Pattern Lab
* Organize your design components and Sass partials
* Leverage SMACSS and BEM to write maintainable CSS
* Control Drupal’s markup
